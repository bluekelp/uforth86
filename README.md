=uForth86=

A micro forth kernel for 32 bit x86 systems.

Performance and efficiency are *not* concerns for now.
Simple code is- and as little of it as possible.  Currently the object file for uforth is ~2500 bytes (without a compiler)

No attempt is made at standards compliance or compatibility with standard Forth words.
